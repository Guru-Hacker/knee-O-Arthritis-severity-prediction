# knee O-Arthritis-dataset-with-severity 
This project presents a deep learning–based system built using the pretrained VGG16 model, chosen for its strong performance on medical imaging tasks. The model classifies the X-ray images into three severity levels of Oeste arthritis:  Healthy (combines KL-grades 0–2: Healthy, Doubtful, Minimal) Moderate (KL-grade 3) Severe (KL-grade 4)  The primary goal of this project is to assist doctors in early diagnosis of arthritis, enabling them to recommend timely and effective preventive measures. For training and evaluation, we used Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) based severity grading datasets, which provided clear and reliable labels for different stages of O-arthritis, simplifying the annotation process.  This project demonstrates how transfer learning and convolutional neural networks can be effectively applied to medical image analysis to support clinical decision-making.
